# New-York-City-Rat-Sighting-Analysis

This project analyzes and visualizes rat sightings across New York City using R. Leveraging data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques, I explored spatial and temporal patterns of rat activity throughout the city.

The analysis included mapping hotspots, identifying seasonal and neighborhood-level trends, and uncovering insights into how environmental and urban factors influence reported sightings. Using tidyverse and ggplot2, the project highlights my ability to work with real-world data, perform exploratory analysis, and create clear, impactful visualizations that support urban planning and public health decision-making.

Tools & Techniques: R, tidyverse, ggplot2, leaflet (mapping), data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), spatial visualization
